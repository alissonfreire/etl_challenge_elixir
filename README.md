Extract Load and Tranform

- Extract: fetch and save all page numbers from remote api
- Load: show pages on web page
- Transform: sort numbers of extracted page numbers

To start your server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
